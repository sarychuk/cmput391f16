Parameter: | Mean RT with Rtree | Mean RT without Rtree
---------------------------------------------------------
   25      |        0.00        |      0.50
   50      |        0.00      |      0.95
   75      |              |
   100     |                    |
   125     |                    |



From the table above we can conclude that R tree is faster.
