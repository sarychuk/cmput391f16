Design a relational schema to represent an RDF data graph. Write in a plain text ASCII file called q6.txt a short report with:
1) Your relational schema and the SQLite statements to create an empty database with that schema

CREATE TABLE rdf_triple (subject TEXT, predicate TEXT, object TEXT);

2) A short (max 2 paragraphs) explanation of your strategy to convert the RDF data into a database according to that schema

We decide that the best way to convert out RDF data was to make a table rdf_triple that contains each of the triples. 

3) An example of a short (say 10-20 triples) input RDF graph and the corresponding relational database; your example should include prefix declarations.
