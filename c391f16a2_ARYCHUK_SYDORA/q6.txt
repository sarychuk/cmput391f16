Parameter: | Mean RT with Rtree | Mean RT without Rtree
---------------------------------------------------------
   25      |       <0.0001      |      0.1550
   50      |        0.0005      |      0.6925
   75      |        0.0515      |      1.2050
   100     |        0.2075      |      1.8180
   125     |        0.2125      |      2.2075



From the table above we can conclude that R tree is faster.
The times for both increase exponentialy for both cases with and without the RTree.
